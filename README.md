# Modern Web development with Scala

This is the activator template of sample event sourcing application that we will be building over the course of the [Modern web Development with Scala](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-scala) book.

## Description

The template is loosely based on the "play-scala" Lightbend template, but it's much simpler.

## Versions used

The code uses Play 2.5 and Scala 2.11.8 along with sbt 0.13.11.
